<p>This processor wraps the evaluation from <a href="https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/1.9.1/manual/opennlp.html#tools.sentdetect">OpenNLP Sentence Detector</a>.
    The OpenNLP Sentence Detector can detect that a punctuation character marks the end of a sentence or not.
    In this sense a sentence is defined as the longest white space trimmed character sequence between two punctuation marks.
    The first and last sentence make an exception to this rule.
    The first non whitespace character is assumed to be the begin of a sentence, and the last non whitespace character is assumed to be a sentence end.
    It creates its model from training data provided to the processor via configuration.</p>

<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>TrainableSentenceDetector takes training data in in a proprietary format.
    Which is one sentence per line.
    An empty line indicates a document boundary.
    In case the document boundary is unknown, its recommended to have an empty line every few ten sentences.
    Here is a sample format:</p>
<pre>
Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29. Mr. Vinken is
chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group. Rudolph Agnew, 55 years
old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, was named a director of this
British industrial conglomerate.
</pre>
<p>Training data is passed either via a file or directly in properties as raw data.
    In case both properties would be set, then the model would be trained by:</p>
<ol>
    <li>training data file first</li>
    <li>then the training data</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
<p>TrainableSentenceDetector runs against full text, meaning it will read the flow file content.</p>

<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>TrainableSentenceDetector will enrich flow file attributes with</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>nlp.sentence.detector.sentences.list</strong>: the sentences list</li>
    <li><strong>nlp.sentence.detector.sentences.span</strong>: the sentences spans</li>
</ul>
