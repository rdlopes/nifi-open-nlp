<p>This processor takes in a record set and counts both the overall count and counts that are defined as dynamic properties
    that map a property name to a record path. Record path counts are provided at two levels:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The overall count of all records that successfully evaluated a record path.</li>
    <li>A breakdown of counts of unique values that matched the record path operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the following record structure:</p>
<pre>
        {
            "sport": "Soccer",
            "name": "John Smith"
        }
    </pre>
<p>A valid mapping here would be <em>sport => /sport</em>.</p>
<p>For a record set with JSON like that, five entries and 3 instances of soccer and two instances of football, it would set the following
    attributes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>record_count: 5</li>
    <li>sport: 5</li>
    <li>sport.Soccer: 3</li>
    <li>sport.Football: 2</li>
</ul>
