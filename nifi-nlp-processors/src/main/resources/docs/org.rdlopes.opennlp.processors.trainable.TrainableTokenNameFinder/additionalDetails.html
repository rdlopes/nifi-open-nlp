<p>This processor wraps the evaluation from <a href="https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/1.9.1/manual/opennlp.html#tools.namefind">OpenNLP Name Finder</a>.
    The Name Finder can detect named entities and numbers in text.
    To be able to detect entities the Name Finder needs a model.
    The model is dependent on the language and entity type it was trained for.
    The OpenNLP projects offers a number of pre-trained name finder models which are trained on various freely available corpora.
    They can be downloaded at our model download page. To find names in raw text the text must be segmented into tokens and sentences.
    It is important that the tokenization for the training data and the input text is identical.
    It creates its model from training data provided to the processor via configuration.</p>

<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>The training data must be provided in Open NLP proprietary format.
    This is one sentence per line.
    Some other formats are available as well.
    The sentence must be tokenized and contain spans which mark the entities.
    Documents are separated by empty lines which trigger the reset of the adaptive feature generators.
    A training file can contain multiple types.
    If the training file contains multiple types the created model will also be able to detect these multiple types.</p>
<p>Sample sentence of the data:</p>
<pre>
&lt;START:person&gt; Pierre Vinken &lt;END&gt; , 61 years old , will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29 .
Mr . &lt;START:person&gt; Vinken &lt;END&gt; is chairman of Elsevier N.V. , the Dutch publishing group .
</pre>
<p>The training data should contain at least 15000 sentences to create a model which performs well.</p>
<p>Training data is passed either via a file or directly in properties as raw data.
    In case both properties would be set, then the model would be trained by:</p>
<ol>
    <li>training data file first</li>
    <li>then the training data</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
<p>TrainableNameFinder runs against:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A tokens list, as produced by a
        <a href="../org.rdlopes.opennlp.processors.trainable.TrainableTokenizer/additionalDetails.html">TrainableTokenizer</a>
        or a <a href="../org.rdlopes.opennlp.processors.trained.PreTrainedTokenizer/additionalDetails.html">PreTrainedTokenizer</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Input is read directly from flow file attributes, allowing to chain the processors.</p>
<p>Since all data required by the processor lies in the attributes, the processor will not open flow file content.</p>

<h3 id="output">Output</h3>
<p>TrainableNameFinder will enrich flow file attributes with</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>nlp.token.name.finder.names.list</strong>: the names list</li>
    <li><strong>nlp.token.name.finder.names.span</strong>: the names spans</li>
</ul>
